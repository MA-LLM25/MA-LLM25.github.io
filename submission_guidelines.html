      <h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
      <hr>
      <p class="submission-guidelines">
        The First Workshop on Multimedia Analytics with Multimodal Large Language Models (MA-LLM), held in conjunction with ACM Multimedia 2025, welcomes the submission of original research and position papers.
      </p>

      <h2>Submission Types</h2>
      <ul class="submission-types">
        <li>Full research papers: up to 8 pages, excluding references.</li>
        <li>Short research papers: up to 4 pages, excluding references.</li>
        <li>Position papers: up to 4 pages, excluding references.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="submission-guidelines">
        Up to two additional pages may be added for references. The reference pages must only contain references.
        We offer a Fast Track option for papers that were rejected or withdrawn from the main ACM Multimedia 2025 conference (see the Fast Track Submissions guidelines).
        All submissions must describe original work that has not been previously published or currently submitted elsewhere. Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Workshop Proceedings and will be available in the ACM Digital Library.
      </p>

      <h2>Formatting and Templates</h2>
      <p class="submission-guidelines">
        Submissions must follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">ACM Article Template</a>. Please use the template in traditional double-column format to prepare your submissions. For example, word users should use Word Interim Template, and LaTeX users should use sample-sigconf-authordraft template.
        Please ensure that your paper is formatted correctly before submission; all figures and tables must be clearly readable.
      </p>

      <h2>Submission System</h2>
      <p class="submission-guidelines">
        All papers must be submitted via <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Workshop/MA-LLM" target="_blank">OpenReview</a>:
        Each co-author must have an up-to-date OpenReview profile. If a new profile is created:
      </p>
      <ul class="submission-types">
        <li>Using an institutional email address, it is typically approved automatically.</li>
        <li>Using a non-institutional email address, it may undergo manual moderation, which can take up to two weeks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="submission-guidelines">
        We strongly encourage authors to verify their OpenReview accounts in advance.
        The following page contains information on how to create an OpenReview profile: <a href="https://docs.openreview.net/getting-started/creating-an-openreview-profile" target="_blank">https://docs.openreview.net/getting-started/creating-an-openreview-profile</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Fast Track Submissions Guidelines</h2>
      <p class="submission-guidelines">
        We offer a Fast Track option for papers that were rejected or withdrawn from the main ACM Multimedia 2025 conference. Authors must submit a new paper to the MA-LLM OpenReview page and include the submitted paper (.pdf format) and the following supplementary materials:
      </p>
      <ul class="submission-types">
        <li>The original ACM MM 2025 submission PDF.</li>
        <li>A PDF containing the complete set of ACM MM 2025 reviews and the corresponding OpenReview link.</li>
        <li>A short cover letter where the authors briefly outline whether they have addressed any of the issues raised in the main review and, if so, how these revisions were implemented. Minor revisions are expected, and it is acceptable if no revisions are made where the work is already deemed to be in good shape.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="submission-guidelines">
        Reviews may be verified with the main conference, any attempt to modify or manipulate review comments will result in desk rejection.
      </p>

      <h2>Review Process</h2>
      <p class="submission-guidelines">
        Each submission will undergo double-blind peer review by members of the MA-LLM Program Committee. For submissions to the Fast Track, papers that received constructive or borderline reviews from ACM MM 2025 may bypass standard peer review or receive a reduced number of reviews, at the discretion of the organizers. In such cases, meta-reviewers will evaluate the submission based on the original ACM MM reviews and the authors' response letter. However, the workshop organizers reserve the right to send any Fast Track submission for full review if deemed necessary.
      </p>

      <h2>Publication and Presentation</h2>
      <p class="submission-guidelines">
        At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and present the work in person in Dublin, Ireland, on October 27, 2025. Presentation details and scheduling will be announced closer to the workshop date.
      </p>
